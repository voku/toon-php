and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **TOON Specification v4.1 compliance** (upstream advanced v3.3 → v4.1). See `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Nested field groups (§9.3)**: a tabular column whose values are uniform non-empty objects is declared as a nested field group — `forecast[3]{day,temp{min,max},condition}:` — while rows stay flat, delimiter-separated primitives laid out by a depth-first walk. Groups nest without a depth cap. An array that v3 dropped to list form because one value was an object now stays tabular.
- **Keyed tabular form (§9.5)**: an object with at least two entries whose values are uniform non-empty objects collapses into `stations[3:]{lat,lon,active}:` with one `entrykey: cells` row per entry. It applies in object-field position and at the document root, and its header may carry nested field groups. Array elements are anonymous and never use the keyed form.
- **Comment lines (§5.1)**: a line whose first character after zero or more spaces is `#` is a comment, removed by the decoder in a lexical pre-pass in strict and non-strict mode alike. Comments never terminate a scope and never count toward a declared length. There is no inline or trailing comment form, and encoders never emit one.
- **`indentSize` option (§13)**: `EncodeOptions` and `DecodeOptions` accept `indentSize`, with `withIndentSize()` alongside the existing `withIndent()`. The former `indent` name remains as a deprecated alias.
- **Byte-order mark and CRLF handling (§12)**: a single leading U+FEFF is removed before any processing, a trailing CR is excluded from each line's content, and trailing spaces are stripped before line classification.
- Spec conformance tests in `tests/Spec/Version4ComplianceTest.php`.

### Changed

- **Empty arrays (§9.1)**: the encoder now emits `key: []` in object-field position and `[]` at the root. The legacy `key[0]:` / `[0]:` header forms are no longer emitted; the decoder still accepts them. An inner list-item array keeps `- [0]:` per §9.2. Because PHP represents both `[]` and `{}` as an empty array, `Toon::encode([])` now returns `[]` rather than an empty document.
- **List-item depth model (§10)**: a scope opened by the field carried on a list-item hyphen line now has its content at depth +2. Previously a nested object or nested list array as the first field was emitted at depth +1, which collided with the object's sibling fields and did not round-trip.
- **Delimiter declaration (§11.1)**: every header now declares the document delimiter, including list-form headers, which previously omitted the delimiter symbol.
- **Number grammar (§4)**: an unquoted token decodes as a number only when it matches `/^-?[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?(?:e[+-]?[0-9]+)?$/i` without forbidden leading zeros. `.5`, `1.`, `+5`, `Infinity`, `NaN`, `0x10` and `1_000` now decode as strings; the decision is no longer delegated to PHP's wider `is_numeric()`. On the encode side, the numeric-like quoting trigger covers leading-plus forms, so `"+1"` is emitted quoted.
- **`#` quoting (§7.2)**: strings that equal or start with `#` are always quoted, so encoder output can never be read back as a comment line.
- **Unquoted key tokens (§7.4)**: the decoder accepts any token before the first unquoted colon as a literal key, so `foo-bar: 1`, `2key`, and `5]: x` are valid input in strict mode too.
- **Quoted-token boundary (§7.4)**: a token whose first character is `"` must end at its closing quote; any character after it is an error in both modes.
- **Object field values (§11.2)**: the entire post-colon token is parsed as a single value. `nums: [3]: 1,2,3` is a key-value line whose value is the string `[3]: 1,2,3`; the header form is `nums[3]: 1,2,3`.
- **Keyless header positions (§6, §14.2)**: a keyless non-keyed header is valid only as the document's root header or as a list item, and a keyless fields-bearing header only at the root. `key:` followed by an indented `[N]:` is now a strict-mode error rather than a nested array.
- **Non-strict count and width tolerance (§14.1)**: a declared `[N]` never terminates or truncates a scope. On a width mismatch the §9.3 field walk applies unchanged — a leaf field with no remaining cell is absent from the decoded object, and surplus cells contribute nothing. Width mismatches are no longer errors when `strict: false`.
- **Blank lines and the header span (§12)**: a header's span runs from its first item, row, or entry line through the last line of its content, so a blank line between a header and its first row is now ignored in strict mode instead of erroring. Blank lines inside the span remain a strict-mode error.
- A bare `{fields}:` header without a bracket segment is no longer recognized; §6 requires every header to carry one.

### Fixed

- **Round-trip for a nested object as a list item's first field**: `[['a' => ['b' => 1], 'c' => 2]]` previously encoded `b: 1` at the same depth as the sibling field `c`, so it decoded back as a sibling rather than a child. The §10 depth model fixes this.

### Dependencies

- **`ext-mbstring`** is now declared in `composer.json`. The encoder and decoder call `mb_check_encoding()` and `mb_chr()`; the extension was previously an undeclared runtime requirement.

### Security

- **Ill-formed UTF-8 (§4, §14.2)**: byte input that is not well-formed UTF-8 is rejected in strict mode instead of being silently substituted with U+FFFD.
- **Unpaired surrogates (§3)**: the encoder rejects host strings that are not well-formed UTF-8 rather than emitting them or substituting U+FFFD.
- **Prototype-key safety (§15)**: documented — PHP arrays have no prototype chain, so `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype` decode as ordinary own entries with no special handling.

### Removed

- **Key folding and path expansion (§1.9, §13.4, §14.3 of the v3 spec)**: removed from the specification in v4.0. The library never implemented them, so no API changes. Dotted keys such as `data.meta.items` remain single literal keys.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Decoder round-trip regression (§6/§7.1)**: quoted string values containing `[` or `{` — for example `k: "a[3]b"`, or log lines carrying ANSI escape sequences such as `"[31m…"` — were misread as array headers and raised `SyntaxException: Unterminated quoted string` on decode. Header detection now locates the `:` separator and the `[`/`{` markers outside quoted spans, so encoder output round-trips through `Toon::decode()` for every string value. Regression introduced in v3.2.0 (v3.1.0 was unaffected). Added comprehensive bidirectional round-trip test coverage (`tests/Spec/RoundTripSpecialStringsTest.php`, `tests/Spec/ComprehensiveRoundTripTest.php`).

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **TOON Specification v3.3 compliance** (upstream advanced v3.0 → v3.3). See `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Unicode escapes (§7.1)**: encoder emits C0 control characters (U+0000–U+001F except `\n`, `\r`, `\t`) as `\uXXXX`; decoder accepts `\uXXXX` (case-insensitive hex) and rejects lone surrogates and escapes with fewer than four hex digits.
- **Empty-array decoding (§9.1)**: decoder now accepts the canonical `[]` and `key: []` forms in addition to the legacy `[0]:` / `key[0]:` forms.
- **Validation API**: `Toon::validate()`, `toon_validate()` and `toon_validate_lenient()` for checking TOON syntax without decoding.
- Spec conformance tests in `tests/Spec/Version31To33ComplianceTest.php`.

### Changed

- **Number formatting (§2)**: finite numbers use canonical decimal only for `n = 0` or `1e-6 ≤ |n| < 1e21`; values outside that range use exponent notation (lowercase `e`, explicit sign, e.g. `1e+21`, `1e-7`). Large in-domain floats are no longer quoted as strings, and very small numbers no longer underflow to `0`.
- **Control characters**: no longer rejected on encode — they are escaped and preserved as data (§15).
- **Strict decoding**: now rejects leading-zero / malformed bracket lengths such as `[03]` (§6, §14.2), header delimiter mismatches where the bracket delimiter differs from the field-list delimiter, e.g. `rows[2|]{a,b}:` (§6, §14.2), and duplicate sibling keys at the same depth (§8, §14.4). Non-strict mode treats malformed bracket tokens as literal keys and applies last-write-wins for duplicate keys.

### Fixed

- **Decoder**: quoted object keys containing colons (e.g. `"App\\Controller::method"`) now decode correctly (#4, #5).
- **Decoder**: `key: []` previously decoded to `null` and a bare `[]` crashed with an uninitialized-offset warning; both now decode to an empty array.
- **Decoder — single-line list items (§9.2/§9.4/§10)**: a list item whose entire content is on the hyphen line now decodes by shape instead of as a plain string — `- [M]: …` → inner array, `- key: …` → object, bare `-` → empty object. This fixes round-trips for arrays of arrays and lists of single-field objects. Nested arrays of objects/arrays as list items also round-trip now.
- **Decoder — empty document (§5)**: an empty or whitespace-only document decodes to an empty object (`[]`) in both modes, instead of throwing (strict) or returning `null` (lenient).
- **Decoder — bare `key:` (§8)**: decodes to an empty object (`[]`), not `null`.
- **Decoder — quoted header keys (§7.4)**: a quoted key prefix such as `"my-key"[3]:` is unescaped.
- **Decoder — empty inline/tabular tokens (§9.1/§11.2)**: decode to the empty string instead of throwing (e.g. `[3]: a,,b` → `['a','','b']`).
- **Decoder — backslash handling (§7.1/§11.2)**: an unquoted backslash is a literal character (escapes apply only inside quoted strings), and colon detection tracks quote state so a key ending in an escaped backslash (`"a\\": c`) parses.
- **Options (§12)**: `EncodeOptions`/`DecodeOptions` reject `indent < 1` (indent `0` cannot represent nesting); `EncodeOptions::compact()` now uses `indent: 1` so nested output round-trips.
- **Validation**: `Toon::validate()` now runs the full decoder internally and returns `false` only when `decode()` throws, so validation and decoding can never disagree. The separate validator implementation (which had drifted from the decoder on duplicate keys, malformed brackets, and over-indented list fields) was removed.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- **toJSON() support**: Objects with a `toJSON()` method can now provide custom serialization, similar to `JSON.stringify` in JavaScript. The method takes priority over `JsonSerializable` interface and includes recursion protection
- **v3.0 spec tests**: Added `tests/Spec/Version3BreakingChangesTest.php` with 6 tests verifying v3.0 compliance
- **Round-trip test**: Added `test_tabular_first_field_in_list_item_round_trip` to verify v3.0 format survives encode/decode cycles

### Changed

- **TOON Specification v3.0 compliance**: Updated encoder to follow v3.0 breaking change in Section 10 (Objects as List Items)
  - When a list-item object has a tabular array as its first field, tabular rows now appear at depth +2 (was depth +1)
  - Sibling fields remain at depth +1 from the hyphen line
- **Decoder**: Already correctly handles both old and new indentation patterns (no changes required)

### Fixed

- **Decoder**: Now correctly treats negative numbers with leading zeros (e.g., `-05`, `-0001`) as strings per TOON Specification §2.4

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-13

### Breaking Changes

This major release aligns with **TOON Specification v2.0**, which removes the optional `#` length marker prefix from array headers. The library version now matches the spec version for clarity.

#### Removed Features

- **`EncodeOptions::$lengthMarker` parameter** - The optional length marker parameter has been removed from the constructor
- **`EncodeOptions::withLengthMarkers()` preset** - This preset method has been removed
- **`EncodeOptions::withLengthMarker()` method** - This fluent setter has been removed

#### Changed Behavior

- **Encoder**: Always emits `[N]` format (e.g., `[3]: a,b,c`). The deprecated `[#N]` format is no longer supported.
- **Decoder**: Now rejects `[#N]` format with `SyntaxException`. Previously accepted both `[N]` and `[#N]` formats.

#### Migration Guide

**Before (v1.x):**

```php
use HelgeSverre\Toon\EncodeOptions;
use HelgeSverre\Toon\Toon;

// Using preset with length markers
$options = EncodeOptions::withLengthMarkers();
$toon = Toon::encode($data, $options);
// Output: [#3]: a,b,c

// Using constructor
$options = new EncodeOptions(lengthMarker: '#');
$toon = Toon::encode($data, $options);
```

**After (v2.0):**

```php
use HelgeSverre\Toon\EncodeOptions;
use HelgeSverre\Toon\Toon;

// Use default options (no length marker parameter)
$options = EncodeOptions::default();
$toon = Toon::encode($data, $options);
// Output: [3]: a,b,c

// Constructor no longer accepts lengthMarker
$options = new EncodeOptions();
$toon = Toon::encode($data, $options);
```

### Changed

- **TOON Specification updated to v2.0** - Spec now explicitly prohibits `[#N]` format
- **Encoder implementation** - Removed all length marker logic, always emits `[N]` format
- **Decoder implementation** - Added strict validation to reject `[#N]` format with clear error messages
- **EncodeOptions simplified** - Removed `lengthMarker` parameter and related methods

### Removed

- `EncodeOptions::$lengthMarker` property
- `EncodeOptions::withLengthMarkers()` static method
- `EncodeOptions::withLengthMarker()` instance method

### Fixed

- **Locale-dependent float formatting (Critical)**: Fixed `sprintf()` calls that were locale-dependent, causing decimal points to become commas in locales like `da_DK`, `de_DE`, etc. Now uses `number_format()` with explicit decimal point separator for guaranteed locale-independent formatting per TOON Spec §2. This ensures output is always valid regardless of system locale settings.
- **Control character handling (Security)**: Strings containing unsupported control characters (0x00-0x08, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0E-0x1F) are now rejected with `InvalidArgumentException`. Per TOON Spec §7.1, only `\n`, `\r`, and `\t` have defined escape sequences. This prevents potential security issues from raw control characters in output.
- **Decoder error messages**: Pattern `[N#]` (hash after digits) now produces the correct v2.0 error message instead of a generic error
- **Test coverage**: Added 10 comprehensive tests for v2.0 breaking change verification (`tests/Spec/Version2BreakingChangesTest.php`)
- **Test coverage**: Added 5 tests for control character rejection

### Documentation

- Updated `docs/SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md` with control character policy and v2.0 verification details
- Test count: 544 tests (up from 512 in v1.4.0), 997 assertions

### Fixed

- **Tab delimiter encoding**: Fixed tab delimiter to use actual tab character instead of literal `\t` string in array headers
- **Keyword matching**: Changed keyword detection to be case-sensitive (per TOON spec) - only `true`, `false`, `null` are quoted, not `True`, `False`, etc.
- **Key encoding**: Implemented separate `encodeKey()` method that uses identifier pattern matching (`^[A-Za-z_][\w.]*$`) instead of applying value quoting rules to keys
