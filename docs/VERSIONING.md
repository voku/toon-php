# TOON Specification Versioning Policy

## Semantic Versioning

The TOON specification follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with a `MAJOR.MINOR` format.

### Version Format

**`MAJOR.MINOR`**

- **MAJOR version** - Incremented for breaking changes that are incompatible with previous versions
- **MINOR version** - Incremented for backward-compatible additions, clarifications, or non-breaking changes

**Example:** Moving from v3.1 to v3.2 is non-breaking – your implementation keeps working. Moving from v2.1 to v3.0 was a MAJOR transition that required encoder updates.

### Specification Version vs Published Package Version

The specification version (e.g., `3.2`) is `MAJOR.MINOR`. Published npm artifacts (`@toon-format/spec`) use full SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `3.2.0`, `3.2.1`); PATCH releases are packaging or editorial-only and do not change the specification version. Implementations targeting a spec version should pin to the `MAJOR.MINOR` line.

## What Constitutes a Breaking Change

Breaking changes (requiring a MAJOR version bump) include:

### Syntax Changes

- Removing or changing existing syntax.
- Changing the meaning of existing constructs.
- Adding new reserved characters that could conflict with existing valid TOON documents.
- Changing encoding/decoding behavior in incompatible ways.

### Semantic Changes

- Changing how valid TOON should be interpreted, except for encoder-unreachable documents (see Non-Breaking Changes).
- Modifying type conversion rules in incompatible ways.
- Changing quoting rules in ways that break existing documents.
- Altering delimiter behavior.

### Conformance Changes

- Making previously valid TOON invalid, except for encoder-unreachable documents (see Non-Breaking Changes).
- Adding new MUST requirements that existing implementations don't meet, except strict-mode-only tightening and encoder-side tightening (see Non-Breaking Changes).
- Changing error handling in ways that break round-trip compatibility.

## What Constitutes a Non-Breaking Change

Non-breaking changes (MINOR version bump) include:

### Clarifications

- Clarifying ambiguous language without changing behavior.
- Adding examples to illustrate existing rules.
- Improving specification wording for clarity.
- Adding informative (non-normative) sections.

### Backward-Compatible Additions

- Adding optional features that don't affect existing documents.
- Adding new SHOULD or MAY recommendations.
- Expanding the specification to cover previously undefined behavior (if done in a backward-compatible way).
- Adding new test cases that existing conformant implementations already pass.
- Adding a normative decoder requirement that broadens accepted input, compatible with existing encoder output.
- Tightening strict-mode validation (adding new strict-mode errors that formalize previously-undefined behavior). Behavior is "previously undefined" when no normative rule of the previous MAJOR version assigned the affected document a decoded value; where the previous version did assign one, changing it is a MAJOR change even if the new outcome is an error. Strict mode is the default, but non-strict mode (`strict=false`) remains a conformant option; documents previously accepted by a non-strict decoder remain accepted.
- Encoder-side tightening: raising a SHOULD or MAY to MUST or MUST NOT for encoder output, or adding a new constraint on what encoders emit. This is MINOR only while every decoder rule of the previous MAJOR version survives unchanged, so output from older encoders keeps decoding as before. Retiring a form the previous version let encoders emit therefore requires keeping the decoder's obligation to accept it.
- Changing the treatment of encoder-unreachable documents. A document is encoder-unreachable when no conforming encoder of the previous MAJOR version could emit it, so it can only have been hand-authored or produced by other means and no round-trip yields it. Reinterpreting such a document, or rejecting it outright, is MINOR.

### Documentation Improvements

- Grammar and typo fixes.
- Reorganizing content for better readability.
- Adding cross-references.
- Improving examples.

## Version Lifecycle

### Working Draft

- Current development version.
- Receives updates through MINOR version increments. Working Draft status means the specification is stable for implementation but not yet finalized; it does not mean the normative text may change silently under a fixed version number.
- Indicated by "Status: Working Draft" in the specification.

### Stable Release

- Released versions are immutable.
- Version number is assigned when changes are merged.
- Previous versions remain available for reference.

### Deprecation

If we need to make a breaking change (MAJOR version bump):

1. **Announcement:** We add a deprecation notice to the current spec
2. **Migration Period:** The next MINOR version includes migration guidance
3. **New Major Version:** Breaking changes are released in the next MAJOR version
4. **Support:** Previous MAJOR versions remain available – we don't break old links

## Implementation Compatibility

When in doubt, we err on the side of caution and treat potentially breaking changes as MAJOR version bumps.

Implementations should document the supported spec version (e.g. `"toon-spec": "3.2"`) and may support multiple versions concurrently: default to the latest, let users target a specific version, and document version-specific behavior. A new MINOR version keeps existing conformant implementations conformant. A new MAJOR version may require updates; previous-version implementations remain valid, and its CHANGELOG.md entry carries the migration guidance. A MINOR version that renames or retires a public concept handle (for example an option name) carries a migration note in CHANGELOG.md naming the old and new spelling.
