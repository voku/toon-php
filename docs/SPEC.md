## Abstract

Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON) is a line-oriented, indentation-based text format that encodes the JSON data model with explicit structure and minimal quoting. Arrays declare their length and an optional field list once; rows use a single active delimiter (comma, tab, or pipe). Objects use indentation instead of braces; strings are quoted only when required. This specification defines TOON's concrete syntax, canonical number formatting, delimiter scoping, and strict-mode validation, and sets conformance requirements for encoders, decoders, and validators. TOON provides a deterministic representation of structured data, with a tabular form for arrays of uniform objects and a keyed tabular form for objects whose values share one uniform shape.

## Introduction (Informative)

### Purpose and Scope

TOON is a token-efficient text format for JSON-shaped data, designed primarily for LLM prompts and contexts where every token costs. It saves tokens vs JSON by declaring array shapes once (length and optional field list) and using indentation in place of braces. TOON is typically used as a translation layer: produce data as JSON in code, encode to TOON for downstream consumption, and decode back to JSON if needed.

### Applicability and Non-Goals

Use TOON when:
- arrays of objects share the same fields (uniform tabular data),
- deterministic, minimally quoted text is desirable,
- explicit lengths and fixed row widths help detect truncation or malformed data,
- you want unambiguous, human-readable structure without repeating keys.

TOON is not intended to replace:
- JSON for non-uniform or deeply nested structures where repeated keys are not dominant,
- CSV for flat, strictly tabular data without nesting,
- general-purpose storage or public APIs. TOON carries the JSON data model; it is a transport/authoring format with explicit structure, not an extended type system or schema language.

Out of scope:
- inline or trailing comments and annotations (full-line comment lines are decode-side syntax, §5.1),
- alternative number systems or locale-specific formatting,
- user-defined escape sequences or control directives.

### Relationship to JSON, CSV, and YAML (Informative)

- **JSON**: TOON preserves the JSON data model. It is more compact for arrays of uniform objects by declaring length and fields once. For non-uniform or deeply nested data, JSON may be more efficient.
- **CSV/TSV**: CSV is typically more compact for flat tables but lacks nesting and type awareness. TOON adds explicit lengths, per-array delimiter scoping, inline field lists (no separate header row), and deterministic quoting, while remaining lightweight.
- **YAML**: TOON uses indentation and hyphen markers but is more constrained and deterministic: full-line comments only (stripped by decoders, never emitted by encoders; §5.1), explicit array headers with lengths, fixed quoting rules, and a narrow escape set.

### Example (Informative)

```
users[2]{id,name,role}:
  1,Ada,admin
  2,Bob,user
```

## 1. Terminology and Conventions

### 1.1 Use of RFC2119 Keywords and Normativity

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All normative text is in Sections 1–16; the appendices and all examples are informative.

### 1.2 Core Concepts

- TOON document: A sequence of UTF-8 text lines formatted according to this spec.
- Line: A sequence of non-newline characters. Serialized documents use LF (U+000A) as the line separator between lines; encoders MUST use LF, not CRLF; decoders accept CRLF input (§12).

### 1.3 Structural Terms

- Indentation level (depth): Leading indentation measured in fixed-size space units (indentSize). Depth 0 has no indentation.
- Indentation unit (indentSize): A fixed number of spaces per level (default 2). Tabs MUST NOT be used for indentation.
- Content depth: The depth at which a scope's immediate content appears – 0 for the root scope, otherwise one level deeper than the depth at which the scope's opening line stands (see §10 for first fields carried on a list-item hyphen line).
- Row depth, entry depth: The content depth of a tabular array's or keyed tabular object's scope, at which its rows or entry rows appear (§9.3, §9.5).

### 1.4 Array and Tabular Terms

A *form* is one rendering of a value. Which form an encoder emits follows from the value's shape under the detection rules of §9 and from the position the value occupies, not from encoder preference; the four forms are:

- Inline form: A primitive array rendered on its own header line, values joined by the active delimiter (§9.1).
- List form: A non-empty array rendered as one list item per line, used when neither the inline form nor a tabular form applies (§9.2, §9.4).
- Tabular form: An array of uniform objects rendered as a header that declares the field list once, followed by one row per element (§9.3).
- Keyed tabular form: An object whose values are uniform objects rendered as a keyed header followed by one entry row per entry (§9.5).

Header terms:

- Header: The bracketed declaration for arrays and keyed tabular objects, optionally followed by a field list, and terminating with a colon; e.g., key[3]:, items[2]{a,b}:, or users[2:]{a,b}: (§9.5).
- Bracket segment: The `[N<delim?>]` portion of a header, declaring the length – or, in its keyed variant `[N:<delim?>]`, the entry count – and optionally the active delimiter (§6).
- Field list: Brace-enclosed, delimiter-separated list of field entries carried by a tabular or keyed header: {f1<delim>f2}. The ABNF production for this construct is named `fields-seg` (§6).
- Field entry: One member of a field list: a field name, optionally carrying its own nested field group (§6, §9.3).
- Nested field group: A field list attached to a field name inside a tabular or keyed header (e.g., customer{name,country}), declaring a nested-uniform column (§9.3, §9.5).
- Leaf field: A field entry without a nested field group. Row and entry-row cells map one-to-one to leaf fields in depth-first header order (§9.3, §9.5).

Row, entry, and item terms:

- Row: A line of delimiter-separated cells under a tabular header, carrying one element's leaf values (§9.3).
- Cell: A single primitive value within a row or entry row (§9.3, §9.5).
- Entry row: A line `entrykey: cell<delim>cell…` under a keyed header, carrying one entry's key and its leaf values (§9.5).
- Entry key: The key token of an entry row, preceding the row's first unquoted colon; it becomes a key of the decoded object (§9.5).
- List item: A line beginning with "- " (or a bare "-" for an empty-object list item, §10) at a given depth representing an element of an array in list form.

### 1.5 Delimiter Terms

- Delimiter: The character separating field entries, inline array values, row cells, and entry-row cells: comma (default), tab (HTAB, U+0009), or pipe ("|").
- Document delimiter: The encoder-selected delimiter used for delimiter-aware quoting where no active delimiter governs (default comma; §11.1).
- Active delimiter: The delimiter declared by the closest header in scope – array or keyed (§11).

### 1.6 Type Terms

- Primitive: string, number, boolean, or null.
- Object: Mapping from string keys to `JsonValue`.
- Array: Ordered sequence of `JsonValue`.
- `JsonValue`: Primitive | Object | Array.

### 1.7 Conformance Terms

- Strict mode: Decoder mode that enforces the checks of §14 (default: true).

### 1.8 Notation

- Regular expressions appear in slash-delimited form.
- ABNF snippets follow RFC 5234; HTAB means the U+0009 character.

## 2. Data Model

- TOON models data as:
  - `JsonPrimitive`: string | number | boolean | null
  - `JsonObject`: { [string]: `JsonValue` }
  - `JsonArray`: `JsonValue`[]
- Ordering:
  - Array order MUST be preserved.
  - Object key order MUST be preserved as encountered by the encoder, except where tabular forms reorder keys to the header's field order (§9.3, §9.5; see the equality rule below). Decoders MUST preserve the document's key order, subject to the host object model; implementations whose object type reorders keys – for example host types that hoist integer-like keys – MUST document the deviation.
- Numbers (canonical form for encoding):
  - Encoders MUST emit finite numbers in canonical decimal form when n = 0, or when 1e-6 ≤ |n| < 1e21:
    - No exponent notation (e.g., 1e6 MUST be rendered as 1000000; 1e-6 as 0.000001).
    - No leading zeros except for the single digit "0" (e.g., "05" is not canonical).
    - No trailing zeros in the fractional part (e.g., 1.5000 MUST be rendered as 1.5).
    - If the fractional part is zero after normalization, emit as an integer (e.g., 1.0 → 1).
    - -0 MUST be normalized to 0.
  - For finite numbers outside the canonical range above (non-zero |n| < 1e-6, or |n| ≥ 1e21), encoders MAY emit exponent notation conforming to the JSON number grammar [RFC8259] §6 (e.g., 1e-7, 1e+21). Encoders SHOULD use lowercase `e` and an explicit exponent sign for byte-for-byte determinism.
  - Encoders MUST emit sufficient precision so that, after any §3 host-type normalization, decode(encode(x)) equals x under the JSON-model equality defined below.
  - If a source value is outside the implementation's documented numeric domain (e.g., arbitrary-precision decimals or integers exceeding that domain), the encoder MAY:
    - Emit a quoted string containing a lossless decimal representation (plain decimal or JSON exponent form); the chosen form MUST be documented.
    - Emit a number that round-trips to the host's numeric approximation (losing precision), provided it conforms to the rules above.
  - Encoders SHOULD expose an option for lossless stringification of out-of-domain numbers.
- Booleans: Encoders MUST emit the lowercase literals true and false.
- Null: Encoders MUST emit the lowercase literal null.
- JSON-model equality: null equals null; booleans compare by value; strings compare by Unicode scalar-value sequence after §7.1 unescaping, with no Unicode normalization; numbers compare by mathematical value after the numeric normalization of this section, so -0 equals 0 and integer-valued numbers compare equal to their integer form; arrays compare by length and pairwise element equality in order; objects compare by the same ordered key sequence and pairwise value equality – except elements of arrays encoded in tabular form (§9.3) and entry values of objects encoded in keyed tabular form (§9.5), whose decoded key order is the header's field order, applied recursively to nested field groups (the first element's or first entry value's encounter order at each level), so their key sequences compare after that reordering.

Decoder numeric rules are defined in §4.

## 3. Encoding Normalization (Reference Encoder)

Encoders MUST normalize non-JSON values to the JSON data model before encoding. The mapping from host-specific types to JSON model is implementation-defined and MUST be documented.

- Number:
  - Finite → number per §2 number form rules.
  - NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity → null.
- String: host strings MUST be sequences of Unicode scalar values. A host string containing an unpaired surrogate (U+D800–U+DFFF) is not representable in TOON; encoders MUST error rather than emit it or silently substitute U+FFFD.
- Implementations MAY honor host-language–specific serialization hooks (for example, JavaScript's `toJSON()`, Go's `json.Marshaler`, Python's `JSONEncoder.default`, Rust's `serde::Serialize`, or an equivalent mechanism) as part of host-type normalization. When supported, such hooks SHOULD take precedence over default host-type mappings for the same value, and their behavior MUST be documented by the implementation.
- Examples of host-type normalization (non-normative):
  - Date/time objects → ISO 8601 string representation [ISO8601].
  - Set-like collections → array.
  - Map-like collections → object (with string keys).
  - Sentinel, non-serializable, or unrecognized host values → null.

See Appendix E for non-normative language-specific examples.

## 4. Decoding Interpretation (Reference Decoder)

Decoders map text tokens to host values:

- Byte input: decoders that accept bytes MUST decode them as UTF-8. In strict mode, ill-formed UTF-8 (invalid or truncated sequences, or bytes encoding surrogate code points) MUST error; it MUST NOT be silently replaced with U+FFFD. Decoders that accept host strings (already decoded from bytes) are outside this rule.
- Quoted tokens (strings and keys):
  - MUST be unescaped per §7.1. Any other escape or an unterminated string MUST error.
  - Quoted primitives remain strings even if they look like numbers/booleans/null.
- Unquoted value tokens:
  - true, false, null → booleans/null.
  - Numeric parsing:
    - Number grammar (normative): an unquoted token decodes as a number if and only if it matches `/^-?[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?(?:e[+-]?[0-9]+)?$/i` (ASCII digits only) and does not carry forbidden leading zeros (below). Any other token – e.g. `.5`, `1.`, `+5`, `Infinity`, `NaN`, `0x10`, `1_000` – decodes as a string. Decoders MUST NOT delegate this decision to a host-language number parser with a wider grammar.
    - Decoders MUST accept decimal and exponent forms on input (e.g., `42`, `-3.14`, `1e-6`, `-1E+9`).
    - Decoders MUST treat tokens with forbidden leading zeros in the integer part (e.g., `"05"`, `"0001"`, `"-05"`, `"-0001"`) as strings, not numbers. This rule does **not** apply to a single zero integer part followed by a fractional or exponent part (e.g., `0.5`, `0e1`, `-0.5`, `-0e1`), which are valid numbers.
    - If a decoded numeric token is not representable within the implementation's documented numeric domain, implementations MAY return a higher-precision numeric type, return a string, return an approximate numeric value, or reject the token (error; permitted in strict mode) if that is the documented policy. Implementations MUST document their out-of-range policy; lossless-first is RECOMMENDED for libraries intended for data interchange or validation.
    - Decoding examples:
      - `1.5000` → `1.5` (trailing zeros in fractional part accepted)
      - `-1E+03` → `-1000` (exponent forms accepted)
      - `-0` → `0` (negative zero decodes to zero; most host environments do not distinguish -0 from 0)
  - The literal token `[]` in object field position (`key: []`), root position (`[]`), and list-item position (`- []`, §9.2) decodes as an empty array (§9.1).
  - Otherwise → string.
- Keys:
  - Decoded as strings (quoted keys MUST be unescaped per §7.1).
  - A colon MUST follow a key; missing colon MUST error.

## 5. Concrete Syntax and Root Form

TOON is a deterministic, line-oriented, indentation-based notation.

- Objects:
  - key: value for primitives.
  - key: alone for nested or empty objects (see §8).
  - Objects whose values are uniform non-empty objects: keyed tabular form key[N:<delim?>]{…}: with one entry row per line (see §9.5).
- Arrays:
  - Non-empty primitive arrays are inline: key[N<delim?>]: v1<delim>v2…; empty arrays use key: [] (§9.1).
  - Arrays of primitive arrays: list form under a header: key[N<delim?>]: then "- [M<delim?>]: …".
  - Arrays of objects:
    - Tabular form when uniform per §9.3's column rules (primitive or nested-object columns): key[N<delim?>]{f1<delim>f2}: then one row per line.
    - Otherwise: list form: key[N<delim?>]: with "- …" items (see §9.4 and §10).
- Root form discovery (applied to the comment-stripped line sequence, §5.1; line classes per §5.2):
  - If the first non-blank depth-0 line is a valid root array header per §6, decode a root array.
  - Else if the first non-blank depth-0 line is a valid keyless keyed header per §6 ([N:<delim?>]{…}:), decode a root object in keyed tabular form (§9.5).
  - Else if the first non-blank line is the literal token `[]`, decode an empty root array (§9.1).
  - Else if the document has exactly one non-blank line and it is neither a valid array header nor a key-value line (quoted or unquoted key), decode a single primitive (examples: `hello`, `42`, `true`).
  - Otherwise, decode an object.
  - An empty document (no non-blank lines after comment removal, §5.1) decodes to an empty object `{}`. A document consisting only of comment and blank lines is therefore `{}`.
  - The root form spans the whole document: once a root array, an empty root array (`[]`), or a keyed tabular root object is complete, no further non-comment, non-blank line may follow. In strict mode, decoders MUST error on such trailing content (§14.2) – it MUST NOT be silently discarded. In non-strict mode, decoders MAY ignore it. (A root object extends to the last line of the document, so this case does not arise for object roots.)
  - In strict mode, if there are two or more non-blank depth-0 lines that are neither headers nor key-value lines, the document is invalid. Example of invalid input (strict mode):
    ```
    hello
    world
    ```

### 5.1 Comment Lines

A comment line is a line whose first character after zero or more leading spaces (U+0020) is "#" (U+0023). Only spaces may precede the "#": a line whose leading whitespace contains a tab is not a comment line. Comments are full-line only: a "#" anywhere else on a line is ordinary content, and no inline or trailing comment form exists.

- Decoders MUST remove comment lines in a lexical pre-pass over the document's lines, in strict and non-strict mode alike. The text of a comment line is discarded without interpretation or unescaping. All subsequent processing – line classification (§5.2), root-form discovery, indentation validation (§12), and the count checks of §14.1 – operates on the comment-stripped line sequence.
- Removing a comment line MUST NOT create, terminate, or otherwise affect any scope: the surrounding lines are treated as adjacent. In particular, a comment between tabular rows or keyed entry rows does not end them, and a comment line is never counted as a row, entry, list item, or blank line.
- A comment line MAY carry any number of leading spaces; the strict-mode indentation checks of §12 do not apply to comment lines.
- Encoders MUST NOT emit comment lines.

Quoting keeps "#"-leading data out of the comment rule: string values that equal "#" or start with "#" are always quoted (§7.2), and unquoted keys cannot start with "#" (§7.3), so conforming encoder output never contains a line whose first non-space character is "#".

### 5.2 Line Classification

Decoders classify each line of the comment-stripped sequence (§5.1) by its content after the leading indentation. The first matching class applies. Classification is lexical; whether a class is admissible at a given depth and position is determined by the enclosing construct (root form above, §8–§10). Within a tabular array's scope, lines at row depth are divided between the row and key-value classes by the disambiguation rules of §9.3, which are authoritative for that position and take precedence over the order below. Within a keyed tabular object's scope, every line at entry depth containing an unquoted colon is an entry row; §9.5 is likewise authoritative for that position.

1. Blank line – the content trims to empty. Handled per §12; blank lines never create or close structure.
2. List-item line – the content is the bare marker "-" or begins with "- " (hyphen, space). The remainder after the marker is parsed per §9.2, §9.4, and §10. Outside the scope of an array in list form, a leading hyphen has no structural meaning and the line is classified by the remaining classes.
3. Array-header line – the content matches the header or keyed-header grammar of §6. A line whose first unquoted colon precedes its first unquoted "[" is never a header; it is a key-value line. Only unquoted occurrences count: a quoted key containing a colon can still open a header (e.g., `"a:b"[2]: 1,2` is a header), while `a:b[2]: x` is a key-value line with key `a`.
4. Key-value line – the content contains an unquoted colon and no earlier class applies. The key token precedes the first unquoted colon and is decoded per §7.4; the remainder after the colon is the value (§8). A line that contains an unquoted colon but fails the §6 header grammar falls through to this class (e.g., `foo [2]: bar`); the strict-mode header errors enumerated in §6 and §14.2 are unaffected by this fall-through.
5. Row line – within a tabular array's scope, a delimiter-separated value line at row depth (§9.3); within a keyed tabular object's scope, an entry row at entry depth (§9.5).
6. Scalar line – none of the above; the content is a single primitive token (§4). A scalar line is valid only as a root primitive (root-form rules above); anywhere else it is a structural error (§14.2).

## 6. Header Syntax (Normative)

Headers declare a length and the active delimiter.

Header shapes:
- Keyless header without a field list: [N<delim?>]:
- With key: key[N<delim?>]:
- Tabular header: key[N<delim?>]{field1<delim>field2<delim>…}:
- Tabular header with a nested field group: key[N<delim?>]{field1<delim>field2{sub1<delim>sub2}<delim>…}: – a field entry carrying its own field list (§9.3)
- Keyed header (objects, §9.5): key[N:<delim?>]{field1<delim>field2<delim>…}: – a colon immediately after the length marks a keyed header; the field list is REQUIRED, and N declares the entry count

Where:
- N is the non-negative integer length (array length, or entry count in a keyed header).
- <delim?> is:
  - absent for comma (","),
  - HTAB (U+0009) for tab,
  - "|" for pipe.
- Field names in braces are separated by the same active delimiter and encoded as keys (§7.3). A field entry MAY be followed by a nested field group; the delimiter inside a nested group is the same active delimiter as the enclosing header.

Spacing and delimiters:
- Every header MUST include a colon after the bracket segment and optional field list.
- Encoder whitespace after the colon and decoder tolerance are governed by §12.
- The bracket segment's delimiter symbol declares the active delimiter for the header and its scope: it splits the header's field list at every nesting level, the inline primitive array on that header line, and the tabular rows or keyed entry rows in the scope (§11.2), unless a nested header declares its own.
- Decoders MUST perform exactly those splits with the declared delimiter; other delimiter characters appearing unquoted in row content are literal data and MUST NOT be re-interpreted as structural delimiters.
- Absence of a delimiter symbol in a bracket segment always means comma, regardless of any parent header.

Normative header grammar (ABNF):
```
; Core rules per RFC 5234 §B.1 (ALPHA, DIGIT, DQUOTE, HTAB)

bracket-seg   = "[" length [ delimsym ] "]"
keyed-seg     = "[" length ":" [ delimsym ] "]"   ; keyed tabular header (§9.5)
length        = "0" / ( %x31-39 *DIGIT )   ; non-negative integer, no leading zeros
delimsym      = HTAB / "|"
; Field entries are keys (quoted/unquoted) separated by the active delimiter,
; each optionally carrying a nested field group (§9.3)
fields-seg    = "{" field-entry *( delim field-entry ) "}"
delim         = delimsym / ","
field-entry   = fieldname [ fields-seg ]
fieldname     = key

header        = [ key ] bracket-seg [ fields-seg ] ":"
keyed-header  = [ key ] keyed-seg fields-seg ":"
key           = unquoted-key / quoted-key
; unquoted-key is the encoder form (§7.3); decoders accept any token (§7.4)
unquoted-key  = ( ALPHA / "_" ) *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "." )
quoted-key    = DQUOTE *quoted-char DQUOTE
; quoted-char is defined in §7.1
```

The ABNF does not express delimiter equality between the `bracket-seg` and `fields-seg` productions; implementations enforce the same-delimiter rule above. A field list containing an unquoted delimiter character other than the one declared by the bracket segment is a header syntax error in strict mode; non-strict decoders MAY fall through to key-value parsing (§14.2).

Note: The grammar above specifies header syntax only. Tabular row disambiguation is defined in §9.3.

Whitespace MUST NOT appear between a key and its bracket segment, and content MUST NOT appear between `]` and `{`/`:` (e.g., `foo [2]:`, `[1][bar]:`, `[2]extra:`, `[2] :`). Such intervening whitespace or content, and the malformed bracket segments enumerated in the decoding requirements below, are strict-mode errors; non-strict decoders MAY parse the line as a key-value line, with the key treated as a literal token.

Decoding requirements:
- The bracket segment MUST parse as a non-negative integer length N with no leading zeros (the single digit `0` is the only canonical form for length zero). Tokens like `[03]` or `[-1]` MUST NOT be interpreted as bracket segments.
- A bracket segment without a length token (`key[]:`) is not a header: strict mode MUST error; non-strict decoders MAY fall through to key-value parsing. This does not affect the empty-array value form `key: []` (§9.1), where `[]` follows the colon.
- A colon immediately after the length and before the optional delimiter symbol marks a keyed header (§9.5): `[N:]` declares comma, `[N:<TAB>]` tab, `[N:|]` pipe. The colon MUST occupy exactly that position – tokens such as `[2|:]`, `[2 :]`, or `[2:,]` are malformed bracket segments, and the length rules above apply unchanged (`[03:]` is malformed).
- A keyed header MUST carry a field list: `key[2:]:` without braces is a header syntax error in strict mode; non-strict decoders MAY fall through to key-value parsing (§14.2).
- If a trailing tab or pipe appears inside the brackets, it selects the active delimiter; otherwise comma is active.
- If a field list occurs between the bracket and the colon, parse field entries recursively using the active delimiter at every nesting level; quoted names MUST be unescaped per §7.1. Brace matching MUST ignore `{` and `}` inside quoted names.
- A field list MUST contain at least one field entry at every nesting level: an empty field list (`{}`, including a nested `field{}`) is a header syntax error in strict mode; non-strict decoders MAY fall through to key-value parsing (§14.2). Unmatched braces in a field list are likewise header syntax errors.
- A colon MUST follow the bracket segment and optional field list; missing colon MUST error.
- A non-keyed header without a field list: content after its colon is an inline primitive array (§9.1); nothing after the colon opens a block scope (§9.2, §9.4). A fields-bearing header – keyed or not – carries no inline content: in strict mode, non-whitespace content after its colon MUST error (§14.2); non-strict decoders MAY fall through to key-value parsing.
- Keyless header positions: a keyless non-keyed header without a field list is valid only as the document's root header (§5) or as a list item after the `- ` marker (§9.2, §9.4); a keyless header with a field list – keyed or not – is valid only as the document's root header. In any other position, strict decoders MUST error (§14.2); non-strict decoders MAY parse the line as a key-value line, with the key treated as a literal token.

Note: Dotted keys are ordinary literal keys in headers. Example: `data.meta.items[2]{id,name}:` is a valid header whose key is the single literal key `data.meta.items`, followed by a standard bracket segment, field list, and colon.

## 7. Strings and Keys

### 7.1 Escaping

In quoted strings and keys, codepoints are encoded according to the following table; rows are matched top-to-bottom, and the first matching row applies. Encoders MUST follow the **Encoder** column; decoders MUST follow the **Decoder** column.

| Codepoint set                                          | Encoder                                       | Decoder                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\` (U+005C)                                           | MUST emit `\\`                                | MUST decode `\\` → `\`                                          |
| `"` (U+0022)                                           | MUST emit `\"`                                | MUST decode `\"` → `"`                                          |
| LF (U+000A)                                            | MUST emit `\n`                                | MUST decode `\n` → LF                                           |
| CR (U+000D)                                            | MUST emit `\r`                                | MUST decode `\r` → CR                                           |
| HTAB (U+0009)                                          | MUST emit `\t`                                | MUST decode `\t` → HTAB                                         |
| Other U+0000–U+001F controls                           | MUST emit `\uXXXX` (lowercase hex SHOULD)     | MUST decode `\uXXXX` (case-insensitive hex)                     |
| U+D800–U+DFFF lone surrogates                          | (not produced by valid encoders)              | MUST reject when decoded from `\uXXXX`                          |
| Other BMP codepoints (U+0020–U+D7FF, U+E000–U+FFFF)    | SHOULD emit literal UTF-8; MAY emit `\uXXXX`  | MUST accept either form                                         |
| Supplementary scalar values (U+10000–U+10FFFF)         | MUST emit as literal UTF-8                    | MUST accept literal UTF-8; surrogate `\uXXXX` escapes MUST be rejected (see row above) |

Decoders MUST reject any escape sequence not listed above, MUST reject `\u` followed by fewer than four hex digits, and MUST reject unterminated strings.

Normative escape grammar:

```abnf
; Core rules per RFC 5234 §B.1 (DIGIT, DQUOTE, HEXDIG); HEXDIG matches hex digits case-insensitively
quoted-char    = escaped-char / unescaped-char
unescaped-char = %x09 / %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-D7FF / %xE000-FFFF / %x10000-10FFFF
escaped-char   = %x5C ( %x5C / DQUOTE / %x6E / %x72 / %x74 / unicode-escape )
unicode-escape = %x75 4HEXDIG
```

Tabs are allowed inside quoted strings and as a declared delimiter; they MUST NOT be used for indentation (§12). Within quoted strings, encoders MUST emit HTAB as `\t` per the escape table above; the literal HTAB in `unescaped-char` expresses decoder leniency only.

### 7.2 Quoting Rules for String Values

Encoders MUST quote a string value if any of the following is true:
- It is empty ("").
- It has leading or trailing whitespace (U+0020 or U+0009).
- It equals true, false, or null (case-sensitive).
- It is numeric-like: matches `/^[+-]?[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?(?:e[+-]?[0-9]+)?$/i` (ASCII digits only) (e.g., "42", "-3.14", "05", "+1", "1e-6").
- It contains a colon (:), double quote ("), or backslash (\\).
- It contains brackets or braces ([, ], {, }).
- It contains control characters in U+0000 through U+001F.
- It contains the relevant delimiter – the active delimiter for inline array values, tabular row cells, and keyed entry-row cells; the document delimiter for object field values (§11.1, which is authoritative for delimiter-aware quoting).
- It equals "-" or starts with "-" (any hyphen at position 0).
- It equals "#" or starts with "#" (any number sign at position 0).

Otherwise, the string MAY be emitted without quotes. Unicode, emoji, and strings with internal (non-leading/trailing) spaces are safe unquoted provided they do not violate the conditions.

### 7.3 Key Encoding

Object keys (including entry keys, §9.5) and the field names in a header's field list:
- MAY be unquoted only if they match: `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.]*$`.
- Otherwise, they MUST be quoted and escaped per §7.1.

Keys requiring quoting per the above rules MUST be quoted in all contexts, including array headers (e.g., "my-key"[N]:).

### 7.4 Decoding Rules for Strings and Keys

Decoding of value tokens follows §4 (unquoted type inference, quoted strings, numeric rules). This section adds key-specific requirements:

- Quoted keys MUST be unescaped per §7.1; any other escape MUST error.
- Keys (quoted or unquoted) MUST be followed by ":"; missing colon MUST error (see also §14.2).
- Unquoted key token (normative): an unquoted key token is the text before the first unquoted colon of a key-value line (§5.2) or entry row (§9.5), with surrounding spaces trimmed (§12); the text before a header's bracket segment; or a field name in a field list (§6). Decoders MUST accept any such token as a literal key, in strict and non-strict mode alike, even when it does not match §7.3's unquoted-key pattern: `foo-bar: 1`, `foo-bar[2]: 1,2`, and `items[1]{2key}:` are valid input. §7.3 constrains what encoders may emit unquoted, not what decoders accept.
- Quoted-token boundary (normative): a token whose first character, after the trimming of §12, is `"` MUST be a complete quoted token – its closing `"` MUST be the token's last character. This applies wherever a token is extracted; any character after the closing quote MUST error. It overrides §4's "Otherwise → string" fallback.
- Symmetrically for values: an unquoted value token that an encoder would have been required to quote (§7.2) is not an error. Decoders, strict mode included, MUST decode it per §4 – unless another rule of this specification assigns the token structural meaning (§5.2, §6, §9.1). Example: `key: -x` decodes to the string `-x`. §7.2 governs encoder output; it adds no decoder-side rejection.

## 8. Objects

- Encoding:
  - Primitive fields: key: value (single space after colon).
  - Nested or empty objects: key: on its own line. If non-empty, nested fields appear at depth +1. An object that satisfies keyed tabular detection instead collapses per §9.5.
  - Key order: Implementations MUST preserve encounter order when emitting fields.
  - An empty object at the root yields an empty document (no lines).
- Dotted keys (e.g., `user.name`) are valid literal keys in TOON. Decoders MUST treat them as single literal keys; the dot has no structural meaning.
- Decoding:
  - Lines in an object body are classified per §5.2; the rules below cover its key-value class.
  - A line "key:" with nothing after the colon at depth d opens an object; subsequent lines at depth > d belong to that object until the depth decreases to ≤ d.
  - In strict mode, the first line of a non-empty nested scope MUST be at exactly depth d+1; a depth increase of more than one level relative to the enclosing scope MUST error (§14.2). Conforming encoders never produce depth jumps; §10's depth model governs fields carried on a list-item hyphen line.
  - A line deeper than the content depth of its enclosing scope whose preceding line did not open a scope belongs to no scope (e.g., a depth d+1 line directly under a depth-d primitive field). In strict mode, decoders MUST error (§14.2) – such lines MUST NOT be silently discarded. In non-strict mode, decoders MAY skip them.
  - A bare `key:` (no value after the colon) MUST decode as an empty or nested object, not an empty array. Empty arrays use the explicit `key: []` form (§9.1).
  - Lines "key: value" at the same depth are sibling fields.
  - Duplicate sibling keys at the same depth: see §14.3 for strict/non-strict behavior.

## 9. Arrays and Tabular Forms

### 9.1 Primitive Arrays – Inline Form

- Encoding:
  - Non-empty arrays: `key[N<delim?>]: v1<delim>v2<delim>…` where each vi is encoded as a primitive (§7) with delimiter-aware quoting.
  - Empty arrays (object field position): encoders MUST emit `key: []`. The legacy header form `key[0<delim?>]:` MUST NOT be emitted.
  - Empty arrays (root position): encoders MUST emit `[]` on its own line. The legacy `[0<delim?>]:` form MUST NOT be emitted.
  - Root arrays: `[N<delim?>]: v1<delim>…`
- Decoding:
  - Split using the active delimiter declared by the header (§11.2).
  - When splitting inline arrays, empty tokens (including those surrounded by whitespace) decode to the empty string.
  - `key[1]:` with nothing after the colon (after §12 trimming) is an array in list form, not an inline array with one empty value (§6); the single empty string is spelled `key[1]: ""`.
  - In strict mode, the number of decoded values MUST equal N; otherwise MUST error (§14.1).
  - Empty arrays: decoders MUST accept `key: []`, `[]`, and the legacy forms `key[0<delim?>]:` and `[0<delim?>]:` as empty arrays.

### 9.2 Arrays of Primitive Arrays – List Form

- Encoding:
  - Parent header: `key[N<delim?>]:` on its own line.
  - Each inner primitive array is a list item:
    - `- [M<delim?>]: v1<delim>v2<delim>…`
    - Empty inner arrays: `- [0<delim?>]:`
    - The `key: []` field-level form (§9.1) does NOT apply to list-item inner arrays; encoders MUST NOT emit `- []`.
- Decoding:
  - Items appear at depth +1, each starting with "- " and an inner array header `[M<delim?>]: …`.
  - Decoders MUST also accept the bare item `- []` as an empty inner array (§9.1).
  - Inner arrays are split using their own active delimiter; in strict mode, counts MUST match M.
  - In strict mode, the number of list items MUST equal outer N.

### 9.3 Arrays of Objects – Tabular Form

Column classification (encoding): a column is the sequence of values at one key across all elements.
- A column is *uniform-primitive* when every value is a primitive.
- A column is *nested-uniform* when every value is a non-empty object, all these objects have the same set of keys (order per object MAY vary), and every sub-column is itself uniform-primitive or nested-uniform. Nesting depth is unbounded.

Tabular detection (encoding; MUST hold for all elements):
- Every element is an object.
- Each object has at least one key; arrays containing any empty object `{}` MUST NOT use tabular form (encode via §9.4 instead).
- All objects have the same set of keys (order per object MAY vary).
- Every column is uniform-primitive or nested-uniform. A column that is neither – e.g., one mixing `null` (a primitive) with objects, or containing any array value or empty object – disqualifies the whole array (encode via §9.4).

When satisfied (encoding), encoders MUST use tabular form, except where §9.4 requires list form:
- Header: `key[N<delim?>]{f1<delim>f2<delim>…}:` where field order is the first object's key encounter order. A uniform-primitive column is emitted as a bare fieldname; a nested-uniform column is emitted as a nested field group `fieldname{…}`, its subfields in the first object's sub-object encounter order, applied recursively.
- Field names at every nesting level encoded per §7.3.
- Rows: one line per object at depth +1 under the header; cells are encoded primitive leaf values (§7) joined by the active delimiter, ordered by a depth-first, pre-order walk of the field list (nested groups expanded in place). Each row's cell count equals the header's leaf-field count.
- Root tabular arrays omit the key: `[N<delim?>]{…}:` followed by rows.

Decoding:
- A tabular header declares the active delimiter and the ordered field list; nested field groups declare nested-object columns. The leaf-field sequence is the depth-first, pre-order walk of the field list.
- Rows appear at depth +1 as delimiter-separated value lines and contain only primitive cells. The empty-array form of §9.1 does not apply inside rows or inline arrays: a cell or inline element `[]` decodes to the string `[]` (§4).
- Each row decodes to an object by walking the field list in header order: a leaf field takes the next cell; a nested field group materializes an object from its subfields, applied recursively. Decoded key order at every level is the header's field order at that level.
- Duplicate field names within the same field list are a header defect (§14.2). In non-strict mode, the duplicated leaf field produces duplicate sibling keys in every decoded element and §14.3's last-write-wins applies. Names repeated at different nesting levels (e.g. `{x,n{x}}`) are not duplicates.
- Strict mode MUST enforce:
  - Each row's cell count equals the leaf-field count.
  - The number of rows equals N.
- Disambiguation at row depth (unquoted tokens; authoritative for the row/key-value choice, referenced from §5.2):
  - Compute the first unquoted occurrence of the active delimiter and the first unquoted colon.
  - If a same-depth line has no unquoted colon → row.
  - If both appear, compare first-unquoted positions:
    - Delimiter before colon → row.
    - Colon before delimiter → key-value line (end of rows).
  - If a line has an unquoted colon but no unquoted active delimiter → key-value line (end of rows).
  - A line that ends the rows this way is not itself a row; it then belongs to no scope and §8 governs its disposition.
- When a tabular array appears as the first field of a list-item object, indentation is governed by §10.

### 9.4 Mixed and Non-Uniform Arrays – List Form

When tabular requirements are not met (encoding; including any column that is neither uniform-primitive nor nested-uniform, §9.3):
- Header: `key[N<delim?>]:`
- Each element is rendered as a list item at depth +1 under the header:
  - Primitive: `- <primitive>`
  - Primitive array: `- [M<delim?>]: v1<delim>…`
  - Array of objects or non-uniform array: `- [M<delim?>]:` on the hyphen line, followed by the nested array's list items at depth +1 relative to the hyphen line (i.e. +2 from the outer array header). Items are encoded recursively per §9.1–§9.4 as each item's shape requires; tabular form (§9.3) is not available in this position (a keyless fields-bearing header is valid only at the document root, §6) – encoders MUST use list form.
  - Object: formatted per §10 (objects as list items).

Decoding:
- Header declares list length N and the active delimiter for any nested inline arrays.
- Each list item is a list-item line (§5.2) starting with "- " at depth +1 (or the bare marker "-" for an empty object list item, §10) and is parsed as:
  - Primitive (no colon and no array header),
  - Inline primitive array (`- [M<delim?>]: …`) or the empty-array item `- []` (§9.2),
  - Object with first field on the hyphen line (`- key: …` or `- key[N…]{…}: …`),
  - Or nested arrays via nested headers.
- A list scope ends when the depth decreases to the header's depth or less, at the first line at item depth that is not a list-item line (§5.2), or at end of input. A line that ends the scope this way belongs to no scope and §8 governs its disposition.
- In strict mode, the number of list items MUST equal N.

### 9.5 Objects of Uniform Objects – Keyed Tabular Form

An object whose values are uniform objects encodes as a table whose rows carry their own keys: the shared field structure appears once in a keyed header (§6), and each entry becomes one entry row.

Keyed tabular detection (encoding; MUST hold):
- The object has at least two entries.
- Every entry value is a non-empty object, all entry values have the same set of keys (order per entry MAY vary), and every column – the sequence of values at one key across all entry values – is uniform-primitive or nested-uniform (§9.3).

When satisfied (encoding):
- Encoders MUST use the keyed tabular form when the object occupies an object-field position (§8) or the document root (§5). As the value of a nested-uniform column it encodes as a nested field group instead (§9.3). Header: `key[N:<delim?>]{f1<delim>f2<delim>…}:` where N is the entry count. Field order, nested field groups, and field-name encoding follow §9.3, with the first entry value in place of the first element.
- Entry rows: one line per entry at depth +1 under the header, in entry encounter order: `entrykey: c1<delim>c2<delim>…`. The entry key is encoded per §7.3, followed by a colon and a single space (§12); the cells are the entry value's primitive leaf values (§7), joined by the active delimiter in depth-first pre-order of the field list (§9.3).
- Root position: when the root object itself satisfies detection, the key is omitted: `[N:<delim?>]{…}:` followed by entry rows. Array elements are anonymous and never encode in keyed tabular form (§10).
- Objects that fail detection encode per §8 unchanged: an empty object stays `key:`, a single-entry object nests, and any column that is neither uniform-primitive nor nested-uniform keeps the whole object in nested form.

Decoding:
- A keyed header declares the entry count N, the active delimiter, and the field list; the field list is REQUIRED (§6). The decoded value is an object with one key per entry row, in row order.
- Entry rows appear at depth +1. Each row is parsed in two steps, in this order: first it is split at its first unquoted colon – the token before the colon is the entry key, decoded per §7.4 (quoted keys unescaped per §7.1); then the remainder is split on the active delimiter into cells and decodes exactly as a §9.3 row (cells map to leaf fields depth-first; nested field groups materialize recursively; decoded key order inside each entry value is the header's field order at every level).
- Cells are primitive tokens (§4). The empty-array form of §9.1 does not apply inside entry rows: `alice: []` is one cell decoding to the string `[]`, and a bare `alice:` has zero cells – a width error in strict mode, since a field list always declares at least one leaf field.
- Line classification at entry depth (authoritative, referenced from §5.2): every line at entry depth containing an unquoted colon is an entry row. The §9.3 colon-before-delimiter rule does not apply – a keyed scope ends only when the depth decreases to the header's depth or less, or at end of input. A line at entry depth without an unquoted colon MUST error in strict mode (§14.2); in non-strict mode, decoders MAY skip it.
- Entry keys are sibling keys of the decoded object; duplicates are governed by §14.3. Duplicate field names within a field list behave as in §9.3.
- Decoders MUST accept any declared entry count N ≥ 0, subject to the strict checks below: `key[0:]{f}:` with no entry rows decodes to `{}`. (Encoders never emit keyed headers for fewer than two entries.)
- Strict mode MUST enforce:
  - The number of entry rows equals N.
  - Each entry row's cell count equals the leaf-field count.
- When a keyed tabular object appears as the first field of a list-item object, indentation is governed by §10.

## 10. Objects as List Items

For an object appearing as a list item:

- Empty object list item: a single "-" at the list-item indentation level.
- Encoding (normative):
  - When a list-item object has a tabular array (§9.3) or keyed tabular object (§9.5) as its first field in encounter order, encoders MUST emit its header on the hyphen line:
    - The hyphen and header appear on the same line at the list-item depth: `- key[N<delim?>]{fields}:` or `- key[N:<delim?>]{fields}:`
    - Rows or entry rows MUST appear at depth +2 (relative to the hyphen line).
    - All other fields of the same object MUST appear at depth +1 under the hyphen line, in encounter order, using normal object field rules (§8).
    - Encoders MUST NOT emit rows or entry rows at depth +1 or sibling fields at the same depth as rows when the first field is a tabular array or keyed tabular object.
  - For all other cases (first field is not a tabular array or keyed tabular object), encoders MUST place the first field on the hyphen line. A bare hyphen on its own line is used only for empty list-item objects.
  - The keyless keyed header is valid only at the root (§5, §9.5): there is no `- [N:<delim?>]{fields}:` list item. An array element that is itself a keyed-eligible object is anonymous and encodes per this section's general rules.
- Decoding (normative):
  - Depth model: a first field carried on a list-item hyphen line at depth d stands at depth d+1 for all scope purposes. A list-item object's fields therefore occupy depth d+1 – the first carried on the hyphen line itself – and a scope opened by that first field (a nested object `- key:`, a non-tabular array header `- key[N<delim?>]:`, tabular rows, or keyed entry rows) has its content at depth d+2; §8's scope rules apply with these depths. A subsequent line at depth d+1 is a further field of the list-item object and terminates the first field's scope.
    - This model applies only to *keyed* first fields. A keyless header on a hyphen line (`- [M<delim?>]:`, §9.2, §9.4) is the list item itself rather than a field of a list-item object, so it stands at depth d and its items are at depth d+1, per §9.4. The presence or absence of the key before the bracket is the discriminator.
  - When a decoder encounters a list-item line (§5.2) of the form `- key[N<delim?>]{fields}:` or `- key[N:<delim?>]{fields}:` at depth d, it MUST treat this as the start of a tabular array or keyed tabular object field named key in the list-item object; its rows or entries are the lines at depth d+2 per the depth model above.
  - All other object-as-list-item patterns (bare hyphen, first field on hyphen line for non-tabular values) otherwise follow the general rules in §8 and §9.

## 11. Delimiters

- Supported delimiters:
  - Comma (default): header omits the delimiter symbol.
  - Tab: header includes HTAB inside brackets and braces (e.g., `[N<TAB>]`, `{a<TAB>b}`); inline arrays, tabular rows, and keyed entry rows use tabs.
  - Pipe: header includes "|" inside brackets and braces; inline arrays, tabular rows, and keyed entry rows use "|".

### 11.1 Encoding Rules

- Document delimiter: Encoders select a document delimiter (option: comma, tab, pipe; default comma). Encoders MUST declare it as the active delimiter of every header they emit (§6); it also governs delimiter-aware quoting for object field values (key: value) and root primitives.
- Active delimiter: Inside a header's scope, the active delimiter governs quoting only for inline array values, tabular row cells, and keyed entry-row cells (§9.5).
- Delimiter-aware quoting:
  - Inline array values, tabular row cells, and keyed entry-row cells: strings containing the active delimiter MUST be quoted.
  - Object field values (key: value): encoders use the document delimiter to decide delimiter-aware quoting, regardless of whether the object appears within an array's scope. Entry rows (§9.5) are not object-field lines: the content after the entry key's colon is a delimiter-joined cell sequence, quoted per the active delimiter.
  - Strings containing non-active delimiters do not require quoting unless another condition applies (§7.2).

### 11.2 Decoding Rules

- Delimiter-aware parsing:
  - Inline arrays, tabular rows, and keyed entry rows (after the entry key is split off at the row's first unquoted colon, §9.5) MUST be split only on the active delimiter declared by the nearest header.
  - Splitting MUST preserve empty tokens; surrounding spaces (U+0020 only, §12) are trimmed, and empty tokens decode to the empty string. An empty cell sequence – the content after an entry key's colon, or after an inline array header's colon, that trims to nothing – is zero cells, not one empty cell; a single empty-string cell is written `""`.
  - Nested headers may change the active delimiter; decoding MUST use the delimiter declared by the nearest header.
- Object field values (key: value): Decoders parse the entire post-colon token as a single value; document delimiter is not a decoder concept.

## 12. Indentation and Whitespace

- Encoding:
  - Encoders MUST use a consistent number of spaces per level (default 2; configurable).
  - Tabs MUST NOT be used for indentation.
  - Encoders MUST emit exactly one ASCII space (U+0020) after the colon in key: value lines and after an entry row's entry-key colon (§9.5).
  - Encoders MUST emit exactly one ASCII space (U+0020) after array headers when followed by inline values.
  - Encoders MUST NOT emit trailing spaces at the end of any line.
  - Encoders MUST NOT emit a trailing newline at the end of the document.
- Decoding:
  - Byte-order mark: a single U+FEFF at the very start of the document is a byte-order mark, not content – decoders MUST remove it before any processing in §5.1 and this section. A U+FEFF anywhere else is content. Encoders MUST NOT emit one.
  - Line terminators: a CR (U+000D) at the end of a line is part of the line terminator, not of the line's content – decoders MUST exclude it before any processing in §5.1 and this section, thereby accepting CRLF input. A CR anywhere else in a line is content.
  - Strict mode:
    - The number of leading spaces on a line MUST be an exact multiple of indentSize; otherwise MUST error.
    - Tabs used as indentation MUST error (see §7.1 for tabs in quoted strings and as the HTAB delimiter).
  - Non-strict mode:
    - Depth MAY be computed as floor(indentSpaces / indentSize).
    - Implementations MAY accept tab characters in indentation. When they do, leading tabs are indentation and MUST be removed from the line's content before classification (§5.2). Depth computation for tabs is implementation-defined and MUST be documented.
  - Trailing spaces: trailing spaces (U+0020) at the end of a line are not part of the line's content. Decoders MUST strip them after the CR exclusion above and before line classification (§5.2); a line whose content is `-` followed only by spaces is therefore the bare marker for an empty-object list item (§9.4, §10), not a list item carrying an empty token.
  - Token trimming: when a token is extracted – a key token before a key-value colon or an entry key's colon (§7.4, §9.5), or a value token after a key-value colon, after an array-header colon, or around each delimiter-separated token – decoders MUST trim surrounding spaces, exactly U+0020, no other characters. Any other whitespace (e.g., NBSP, or HTAB outside its delimiter role) is part of the token; internal semantics follow quoting rules. This trimming does not apply between a key and its bracket segment, where whitespace is a header syntax error (§6).
  - Comment lines are removed before any check in this section applies (§5.1).
  - Blank lines:
    - A line whose content trims to empty is blank, regardless of leading-space count; the indentation checks above do not apply to blank lines.
    - Header span: the lines from the first item, row, or entry line in a header's scope through the last line of that scope's content (which may be a deeper line inside its last item). A blank line inside any header span: in strict mode, MUST error; in non-strict mode, MAY be ignored and not counted as a row/item/entry.
    - All other blank lines – including between a header and the scope's first item, row, or entry line, and after a scope's content: in strict mode, decoders MUST ignore them (they do not create or close structures and are not counted); in non-strict mode, decoders SHOULD ignore them.
  - Trailing newline at end-of-file: decoders SHOULD accept; validators MAY warn.

## 13. Conformance and Options

Encoders, decoders, and validators each have a per-class checklist below (§13.1–§13.3). Conforming encoders and decoders MUST satisfy every applicable item in §13.1 and §13.2; §13.3 lists what validators SHOULD verify.

Option names throughout this specification are concept handles; implementations MAY use language-idiomatic spellings (e.g., `indent_size` in Python, `IndentSize` in Go) when the mapping is documented. Option value tokens (e.g., the delimiter modes comma, tab, and pipe) likewise denote modes; implementations MAY use enums, constants, or other host-idiomatic types.

Options:
- Encoder options:
  - indentSize (default: 2 spaces)
  - delimiter (document delimiter; default: comma; alternatives: tab, pipe)
- Decoder options:
  - indentSize (default: 2 spaces)
  - strict (default: `true`)

Strict-mode errors are enumerated in §14; validators MAY add informative diagnostics for style and encoding invariants.

Implementations SHOULD declare the specification version they target (e.g., `toon-spec: 4.1`) in their documentation.

### 13.1 Encoder Conformance Checklist

Conforming encoders MUST:
- [ ] Produce UTF-8 output with LF (U+000A) line endings (§1.2)
- [ ] Use consistent indentation (default 2 spaces, no tabs) (§12)
- [ ] Escape per §7.1 in quoted strings; never emit other escapes
- [ ] Quote strings per §7.2 (the relevant delimiter is governed by §11.1: document delimiter for object-field values, active delimiter for inline array values, tabular row cells, and keyed entry-row cells)
- [ ] Quote and escape object keys, entry keys, and field names that do not match §7.3's unquoted-key pattern (§7.3)
- [ ] Select the form from the value's shape and position, not by preference (§1.4, §9)
- [ ] Emit declared lengths [N] matching the actual inline value, list item, tabular row, or entry row count (§6, §9)
- [ ] Preserve object key order as encountered, except where tabular forms reorder to the header's field order (§2)
- [ ] Emit numbers per §2
- [ ] Convert -0 to 0 (§2)
- [ ] Emit booleans and null as lowercase literals (§2)
- [ ] Convert NaN/±Infinity to null (§3)
- [ ] Emit no trailing spaces or trailing newline (§12)
- [ ] Emit no comment lines (§5.1)

### 13.2 Decoder Conformance Checklist

Conforming decoders MUST:
- [ ] Accept CRLF input by excluding a trailing CR from each line's content (§12)
- [ ] Remove comment lines in a lexical pre-pass before all structural interpretation (§5.1)
- [ ] Parse array and keyed headers per §6 (length, keyed marker, delimiter, fields including nested field groups)
- [ ] Accept empty arrays in both forms: `key: []` / `[]` and legacy `key[0]:` / `[0]:` (§9.1)
- [ ] Split inline arrays, tabular rows, and keyed entry rows using the active delimiter only (§11)
- [ ] Unescape per §7.1
- [ ] Type unquoted primitives: true/false/null → booleans/null, numeric → number, else → string (§4)
- [ ] Accept any unquoted key token as a literal key even when it does not match §7.3's unquoted-key pattern (§7.4)
- [ ] Enforce strict-mode rules when `strict=true` (§14)
- [ ] Apply deterministic last-write-wins for duplicate sibling keys when `strict=false` (§14.3)
- [ ] Preserve array order and object key order, except where tabular and keyed tabular forms reorder to the header's field order (§2, §9.3, §9.5)
- [ ] Decode byte input as UTF-8 and, in strict mode, error on ill-formed sequences rather than substituting U+FFFD (§4)
- [ ] Document the numeric out-of-range policy (§4) and any key-order or prototype-key deviation of the host object model (§2, §15)

### 13.3 Validator Conformance Checklist

Validators SHOULD verify:
- [ ] Structural conformance (headers, indentation, list markers)
- [ ] Whitespace invariants: no trailing spaces on any line (§12); a trailing newline at end-of-file MAY be warned about, but decoders accept it (§12)
- [ ] Delimiter consistency between headers and rows
- [ ] Array length counts match declared [N]
- [ ] All strict-mode requirements (§14)

## 14. Strict Mode Errors and Diagnostics (Authoritative Checklist)

When strict mode is enabled (default), decoders MUST error on the conditions listed below. Conditions marked "(any mode)" are errors in strict and non-strict mode alike. Error type, code, and message text are implementation-defined.

### 14.1 Array Count and Width Mismatches

- Inline primitive arrays: decoded value count ≠ declared N.
- Arrays in list form: number of list items ≠ declared N.
- Tabular arrays: number of rows ≠ declared N.
- Tabular row width mismatches: any row's cell count ≠ the header's leaf-field count (§9.3; equal to the field count when no nested field groups are present).
- Keyed tabular objects: number of entry rows ≠ declared N; any entry row's cell count ≠ the header's leaf-field count (§9.5; a bare `entrykey:` has zero cells).
- The count checks above apply only when an explicit `[N]` length is declared. The `key: []` form has no declared length; the count check is N/A (§9.1).
- Non-strict counterpart: with `strict=false` a count or width mismatch is not an error. A declared `[N]` never terminates or truncates a scope – decoders decode every inline value, list item, tabular row, and entry row the scope actually contains. On a width mismatch the §9.3 field walk applies unchanged: a leaf field with no remaining cell is absent from the decoded object, and surplus cells contribute nothing.

### 14.2 Syntax and Structural Errors

- Missing colon in key context (any mode; §4, §7.4).
- Invalid escape sequences or unterminated strings in quoted tokens, and characters after a quoted token's closing quote (any mode; §4, §7.1, §7.4).
- Header delimiter mismatch (§6): MUST error as a header syntax error, independent of row width/count checks.
- Malformed bracket lengths and malformed keyed markers in headers (§6).
- Malformed field lists in headers: an empty field list (`{}`, including a nested `field{}`), unmatched braces, or a field name repeated within the same field list (`{a,a}`, including inside a nested group); see §6, §9.3, §9.5. These are diagnosed from the header line alone, independent of the declared count and of any following rows or entry rows.
- Keyed headers (§9.5): a missing field list (`key[2:]:`), a keyless keyed header anywhere other than as the document's root header, or a line at entry depth without an unquoted colon.
- Non-whitespace content after a fields-bearing header's colon (§6), keyed or not (e.g., `items[2]{a,b}: 1,2`).
- Keyless headers outside their valid positions (§6): a keyless non-keyed header in object-field position (e.g., `[2]: x,y` under an object field, or as a non-first depth-0 line), or a keyless fields-bearing header as a list item (`- [2]{a}:`).
- Any whitespace between a key and its bracket segment, and any content between a valid bracket segment and the colon (or field list), prevents array-header interpretation; decoders MUST NOT silently discard that content. In non-strict mode, decoders MAY fall through to key-value parsing.
- Indentation and blank-line invariants per §12, evaluated after comment removal (§5.1).
- Indentation depth jumps (§8): a line more than one level deeper than its enclosing scope (e.g., a depth d+2 line directly under a depth-d parent).
- Over-indented lines (§8): a line deeper than the content depth of its enclosing scope when the preceding line did not open a scope (e.g., a depth d+1 line directly under a depth-d primitive field). Decoders MUST NOT silently discard such lines.
- Trailing content after a completed root form (§5): any non-comment, non-blank line following the inline values, rows, items, or entries of a root array or keyed tabular root object, or following a root `[]`.
- Ill-formed UTF-8 in byte input (§4).
- A scalar line (§5.2) anywhere other than root primitive position – e.g., a bare token line inside an array or object scope (any mode; §5.2).
- Two or more non-blank depth-0 lines that are neither headers nor key-value lines (§5) (any mode).

### 14.3 Duplicate Object Keys

When two or more sibling fields at the same depth share the same literal key (entry keys of a keyed tabular object, §9.5, are sibling keys of the decoded object and fall under this rule):

- With `strict=true` (default): Decoders MUST error.
- With `strict=false`: Decoders MUST apply deterministic last-write-wins (LWW) resolution in document order, silently (no diagnostic).

## 15. Security Considerations

- Injection and ambiguity are mitigated by the quoting rules in §7.2, which bind encoders. The mitigation is a property of conforming encoder output: an unquoted marker in input is decoded per §4 unless another rule assigns the token structural meaning.
- Prototype-key safety: No key has special meaning in TOON; decoders MUST materialize every key (including `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`) as an ordinary own entry, and decoding MUST NOT mutate prototype chains, class metadata, or any other shared state of the host object model. Implementations whose default object type cannot hold such keys as ordinary own entries MUST use a representation that can (e.g., a map type) and MUST document the behavior.
- Strict-mode checks (§14) detect malformed strings, truncation, or injected rows/items/entries via length and width mismatches.
- Encoders SHOULD avoid excessive memory on large inputs; implement streaming/tabular row emission where feasible.
- A declared length is attacker-controlled: a few bytes can declare a huge N. Decoders SHOULD NOT reserve storage in proportion to a declared N before that many values, items, rows, or entry rows have actually been read.
- This specification places no limit on nesting depth or document size. Decoders that recurse over nesting MAY impose a documented depth limit and report exceeding it as an error rather than exhausting the host stack.
- Control characters in quoted strings (`\uXXXX`, §7.1) are preserved as data values; encoders MUST NOT strip them during normalization. Note: downstream consumers that render decoded values into terminals, logs, or markup contexts are advised to sanitize or escape control characters at that boundary, since TOON preserves them faithfully as data.
- Encoders SHOULD avoid altering Unicode beyond required escaping.

## 16. Internationalization

- Full Unicode is supported in keys and values, subject to the quoting and escaping rules of §7.1 and §7.3. §7.3's unquoted-key pattern is ASCII-only, so conforming encoders quote every non-ASCII key.
- Keys that are canonically equivalent but differ in normalization form are distinct (§2) and do not trigger §14.3's duplicate-key rule.
- Encoders MUST NOT apply locale-dependent formatting for numbers or booleans (e.g., no thousands separators).

## 17. IANA Considerations

This specification does not request IANA registration at this time.

- Provisional media type: `text/toon`
- File extension: `.toon`
- Charset: always UTF-8; the `charset=utf-8` parameter may be specified and is assumed if absent.

Formal registration will be requested following the procedures defined in [RFC6838] once the media type is no longer provisional.

## 18. Versioning and Extensibility

For the versioning policy, see [VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md); for version history, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

### Extensibility

- Backward-compatible evolutions should preserve current headers, quoting rules, and indentation semantics.
- Reserved/structural characters (colon, brackets, braces, hyphen, and the number sign at line start, §5.1) retain their current meanings across versions.

## 19. Intellectual Property Considerations

This specification is released under the MIT License (see repository and Appendix D for details). No patent disclosures are known at the time of publication. The authors intend this specification to be freely implementable without royalty requirements.

Implementers should be aware that this is a community specification and not a formal standards-track document from a recognized standards body (such as IETF, W3C, or ISO). No formal patent review process has been conducted. Implementers are responsible for conducting their own intellectual property due diligence as appropriate for their use case.

## Appendix B: Parsing Helpers (Informative)

These sketches illustrate structure and common decoding helpers. They are informative; normative behavior is defined in §1–§16 (per §1.1).

### B.1 Decoding Overview

- Split input into lines, excluding a trailing CR from each line's content (§12); strip comment lines (§5.1); compute depth from leading spaces and indent size (§12).
- Skip blank lines outside header spans (§12).
- Decide root form per §5.
- For objects at depth d: process lines at depth d; for arrays at depth d: read rows/list items at depth d+1.

### B.2 Array Header Parsing

- Identify the optional key prefix first (quoted: a `"…"` literal at line start; unquoted: the characters up to the first `[`, which contain no whitespace, §6). This sketch applies only to lines §5.2 has already classified as array-header lines. The bracket segment `[ … ]` begins at the first `[` after the key; parse:
  - Length N as decimal integer.
  - A colon immediately after the length marks a keyed header (§9.5); it requires a field list. Entry rows split at their first unquoted colon into entry key and cell sequence; the cells then split on the active delimiter.
  - Optional delimiter symbol at the end: HTAB or pipe (comma otherwise).
- If a "{ … }" field list occurs between the "]" and the ":", parse field entries recursively using the active delimiter: track brace depth, ignoring braces inside quoted names; a fieldname followed by "{" opens a nested field group. Unescape quoted names. The leaf-field list is the depth-first, pre-order walk of the resulting tree; rows assign cells to leaf fields in that order (§9.3).
- Require a colon ":" after the bracket/field list.
- Return the header (key?, length, delimiter, fields?) and any inline values after the colon.
- Absence of a delimiter symbol in the bracket segment always means comma for that header (no inheritance).

### B.3 parseDelimitedValues

- Iterate characters left-to-right while maintaining a current token and an inQuotes flag.
- On a double quote, toggle inQuotes.
- While inQuotes, treat backslash + next char as a literal pair (string parser validates later).
- Only split on the active delimiter when not in quotes (unquoted occurrences).
- Trim surrounding spaces (U+0020 only, §12) around each token. Empty tokens decode to empty string.

### B.4 Primitive Token Parsing

- If token starts with a quote, it must be a properly quoted string (no trailing characters after the closing quote). Unescape per §7.1; otherwise error.
- Else if token is true/false/null → boolean/null.
- Else if the token matches §4's number grammar exactly → number; do not delegate this test to a host-language number parser.
- Else → string.

### B.5 Object and List Item Parsing

- Key-value line: parse a key up to the first unquoted colon (§5.2, §7.4); missing colon → error. The remainder of the line is the primitive value (if present).
  - If the remainder is exactly `[]` → empty array (§9.1).
- Nested object: "key:" with nothing after colon opens a nested object. If this is:
  - A field inside a regular object: nested fields are at depth +1 relative to that line.
  - The first field on a list-item hyphen line: nested fields at depth +2 relative to the hyphen line; subsequent fields at +1.
- List items:
  - Lines start with "- " at one deeper depth than the parent array header (or the bare marker "-" for an empty object list item, §10).
  - After "- ":
    - If the remainder is exactly `[]` → empty inner array (§9.2).
    - If an unquoted "[ … ]:" appears → inline array item; decode with its own header and active delimiter.
    - Else if an unquoted colon appears → object with first field on hyphen line.
    - Else → primitive token.

## Appendix C: Test Suite and Compliance (Informative)

A language-agnostic reference test suite is maintained at [tests/](./tests/); see [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md) for the per-fixture index. The suite is versioned alongside this specification. Implementations are encouraged to validate against it, but conformance is determined solely by adherence to the normative requirements in Sections 1–16; test coverage does not define the specification.

Host-type normalization tests (e.g., BigInt, Date, Set, Map) are language-specific and maintained in implementation repositories. See Appendix E for normalization guidance.

## Appendix E: Host Type Normalization Examples (Informative)

How implementations in different programming languages may normalize host-specific types to the JSON data model before encoding. Normative behavior is defined in §3.

### E.1 Go

Go implementations commonly normalize the following host types:

Numeric Types:
- `big.Int`: If representable as a canonical decimal integer per §2, emit as number; otherwise convert to quoted decimal string per lossless policy.
- `math.Inf()`, `math.NaN()`: Convert to `null`.

Temporal Types:
- `time.Time`: Convert to ISO 8601 string via `.Format(time.RFC3339)` or `.Format(time.RFC3339Nano)`.

Collection Types:
- `map[K]V`: Convert to object. Keys must be strings or convertible to strings via `fmt.Sprint`.
- `[]T` (slices): Preserve as array.

Struct Types:
- Structs with exported fields: Convert to object using JSON struct tags if present.
- Types implementing `json.Marshaler`: Invoke `MarshalJSON()`, parse the returned bytes as JSON, and normalize the result recursively.

Non-Serializable Types:
- `nil`: Maps to `null`.
- Functions, channels, `unsafe.Pointer`: Not serializable; behavior is implementation-defined per §3.

### E.2 JavaScript

JavaScript implementations commonly normalize the following host types:

Numeric Types:
- `BigInt`: If the value is within `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, convert to `number`. Otherwise, convert to a quoted decimal string.
- `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`: Convert to `null`.

Temporal Types:
- `Date`: Convert to ISO 8601 string via `.toISOString()` (e.g., `"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"`).

Collection Types:
- `Set`: Convert to array by iterating entries and normalizing each element.
- `Map`: Convert to object using `String(key)` for keys and normalizing values recursively. Non-string keys are coerced to strings.

Object Types:
- Objects with a `toJSON()` method: Call `value.toJSON()` and normalize the returned value recursively before encoding.
- Plain objects: Enumerate own enumerable string keys in encounter order; normalize values recursively.

Non-Serializable Types:
- `undefined`, `function`, `Symbol`: Convert to `null`.

### E.3 Python

Python implementations commonly normalize the following host types:

Numeric Types:
- `decimal.Decimal`: Convert to `float` if representable without loss, OR convert to quoted decimal string for exact preservation (implementation policy).
- `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, `float('nan')`: Convert to `null`.
- Arbitrary-precision integers (large `int`): Emit as number if within the implementation's documented numeric domain, OR as quoted decimal string per lossless policy.

Temporal Types:
- `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.date`, `datetime.time`: Convert to ISO 8601 string representation via `.isoformat()`.

Collection Types:
- `set`, `frozenset`: Convert to list (array).
- `dict`: Preserve as object with string keys. Non-string keys must be coerced to strings.

Object Types:
- Custom objects: Extract attributes via `__dict__`, register a `JSONEncoder.default` callback, or use `dataclasses.asdict()` for dataclasses; convert to object (dict) with string keys.

Non-Serializable Types:
- `None`: Maps to `null`.
- Functions, lambdas, modules: Convert to `null`.

### E.4 Rust

Rust implementations commonly normalize the following host types (typically using serialization frameworks like `serde`):

Numeric Types:
- `i128`, `u128`: If representable as a canonical decimal integer per §2, emit as number; otherwise convert to quoted decimal string per lossless policy.
- `f64::INFINITY`, `f64::NEG_INFINITY`, `f64::NAN`: Convert to `null`.

Temporal Types:
- `chrono::DateTime<T>`: Convert to ISO 8601 string via `.to_rfc3339()`.
- `chrono::NaiveDate`, `chrono::NaiveTime`: Convert to ISO 8601 partial representations.

Collection Types:
- `HashSet<T>`, `BTreeSet<T>`: Convert to `Vec<T>` (array).
- `HashMap<K, V>`, `BTreeMap<K, V>`: Convert to object. Keys must be strings or convertible to strings via `Display` or `ToString`.

Enum Types:
- Unit variants: Convert to string of variant name (e.g., `Color::Red` → `"Red"`).
- Tuple/struct variants: Typically convert to object with `"type"` field and data fields per `serde` conventions.

Struct Types:
- Types implementing `serde::Serialize`: invoke the trait via the implementation's serializer and normalize the produced JSON value.

Non-Serializable Types:
- `Option::None`: Convert to `null`.
- `Option::Some(T)`: Unwrap and normalize `T`.
- Function pointers, raw pointers: Not serializable; behavior is implementation-defined per §3.

### E.5 Java

Java implementations commonly normalize the following host types:

Numeric Types:
- `BigInteger`: If representable as a canonical decimal integer per §2, emit as number; otherwise convert to quoted decimal string per lossless policy.
- `BigDecimal`: Convert to `double` if representable without loss, OR convert to a quoted decimal string via `.toPlainString()` for exact preservation.
- `Double.NaN`, `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`: Convert to `null`.

Temporal Types:
- `java.time.Instant`, `OffsetDateTime`: Convert to ISO 8601 string via `.toString()`.
- `ZonedDateTime`: Convert via `.toOffsetDateTime().toString()` to produce ISO 8601; `ZonedDateTime.toString()` appends a `[Zone/Id]` bracket that is not standard ISO 8601.
- `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`: Convert to ISO 8601 representations via `.toString()`.

Collection Types:
- `Map<K, V>`: Convert to object. Keys must be non-null strings; non-string keys must be converted via the implementation's documented policy.
- `Collection<T>` (List, Set): Convert to array.

Non-Serializable Types:
- `Optional.empty()`: Maps to `null`. `Optional.of(x)`: unwrap and normalize `x`.
- Functional interfaces (lambdas, method references), reflective types: Not serializable; behavior is implementation-defined per §3.

### E.6 General Guidance

Implementations in any language should:
1. Provide configuration options where multiple strategies are reasonable (e.g., lossless vs. approximate numeric encoding).
2. Ensure that normalization is deterministic: encoding the same host value twice produces identical TOON output.
